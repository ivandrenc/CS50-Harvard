FINAL PROJECT CS50

About me:
My name is Ivan Naranjo, I am 21 years old, I come from Ecuador and living and studying currently in Germany. 

------------RURAL APP-------------
The Rural App can make medical appointments in all hospitals of Ecuador. The app is able to dismiss also appointments with the use of a SQLITE3 database.

How it works:

The app works initially with a login screen, the user have to register first and then give all the information that is needed. After that it will give the user a unique code for  that will be useful for log in. 
Once the user logs in, the user can search with the tab bar controller to search for the city in which he is living. Once the user selects the city, appears all the available hospitals in that city. If the user selects a hospital then it will be displayed in another view all the information of the hospital, as its name, telefone, address, location, and the option of making an appointment for the hospital. 

Specifications:

I used Adobe XD for this projects interface, SQLite3 for saving the appointments and MapKit for locating the address of the hospital.
